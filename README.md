# Personal WireGuard VPN on Fly.io (self-contained HTTPS bootstrap)

Run a personal WireGuard VPN for general web browsing on Fly.io.

Fly.io itself uses WireGuard internally for some features, but this app is **not** part of that; it’s just a small wrapper around the community-maintained [`linuxserver/docker-wireguard`](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-wireguard) image.

This version is designed to be:

- **Self-contained** – everything (including a small HTTP+QR bootstrap server) is built inside Fly’s Docker build.
- **Host-OS agnostic** – you only need `flyctl` installed; no local Docker or Go toolchain required.
- **Easy to bootstrap** – after deploy, you visit a single HTTPS URL to get:
  - A QR code for the WireGuard mobile app.
  - The raw `.conf` for desktop clients.
- **No post-deploy shell** – no `fly ssh` or container shell required.

---

## Prerequisites

- A Fly.io account.
- `flyctl` installed and authenticated (`fly auth login`).
- Basic familiarity with WireGuard on your device (mobile or desktop).
- You are comfortable running a few `fly` CLI commands but don’t want to shell into the app.

---

## Quick start

1. **Clone this project**

   ```bash
   git clone <this-repo-url>
   cd <repo>
   ```

2. **Launch the app (create app + config from `fly.toml`)**

   ```bash
   fly launch --copy-config --no-deploy --generate-name
   ```

   This uses the existing `fly.toml` and the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) in this repo. The image (including the bootstrap server) is built on Fly’s builder VMs, not on your local machine.

3. **Create the config volume (once)**

   ```bash
   fly volumes create config --size 1
   ```

   The linuxserver WireGuard image stores keys and peer configs under `/config`, which is backed by this volume.

4. **(Recommended) Set a one-time bootstrap token**

   ```bash
   fly secrets set BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN='a-very-long-random-string'
   ```

   If you skip this, the bootstrap endpoint will still be one-time, but not token-protected.

5. **Deploy**

   ```bash
   fly deploy
   ```

6. **Bootstrap from your browser (QR + config)**

   Once the app is deployed, open in your browser:

   ```text
   https://<appname>.fly.dev/bootstrap?token=YOUR_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN
   ```

   - If you set `BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`, include `?token=...` as shown.
   - If you did *not* set a token, just open `/bootstrap` without the query string.

   You will see a single HTML page that shows:

   - A QR code you can scan with the WireGuard mobile app (“Scan from QR code”).
   - The full WireGuard configuration text you can copy into a desktop client.

   On first successful load the app writes `/config/bootstrap_done`. Further calls to `/bootstrap` return HTTP 410 (“already bootstrapped”).

7. **Connect**

   Use your WireGuard client as usual; your Fly app is now a WireGuard endpoint listening on UDP port `51820`.

## How it works

This project is thin Fly.io-specific configuration on top of [`linuxserver/docker-wireguard`](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-wireguard) and a small Go HTTP server:

- [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) is a **multi-stage build**:
  - **Stage 1**:
    - Uses `golang:alpine` to build a static `bootstrap-http` binary from [`cmd/bootstrap-http/main.go`](cmd/bootstrap-http/main.go).
  - **Stage 2**:
    - Uses `linuxserver/wireguard:1.0.20210914` as the base.
    - Appends sysctl tweaks to an s6-overlay init script so that at container startup:
      - `net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1` is set.
      - `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` is set (so the instance can forward traffic).
    - Copies `bootstrap-http` into the image and runs it as a sidecar service under s6-overlay.
    - Wraps `/init` with `unshare` + `perl` so s6-overlay can behave as PID 1 in Fly’s environment.

- [`fly.toml`](fly.toml) defines:
  - A UDP service on internal port `51820` exposed externally on `51820` for WireGuard.
  - A TCP service on internal port `8080` exposed as HTTPS on `443` for the bootstrap HTTP server.
  - A volume mount at `/config` named `config` for persistent WireGuard keys and peer configs.
  - Environment variables for the linuxserver image:
    - `PEERS="1"`, `PEERDNS="auto"`, `SERVERPORT=51820`, `PUID=1000`, `PGID=1000`, etc.
  - Environment variables for the bootstrap server:
    - `BOOTSTRAP_PORT="8080"`, `BOOTSTRAP_PEER_NAME="peer1"`.
    - `BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` is set via `fly secrets` for optional auth during bootstrap.

- [`cmd/bootstrap-http/main.go`](cmd/bootstrap-http/main.go) (built into the image) does:
  - Waits for `/config/peer1/peer1.conf` to exist (generated by the WireGuard container).
  - Exposes:
    - `GET /healthz` – returns 200 once the config is ready.
    - `GET /bootstrap` – returns a one-time HTML page with:
      - A QR code, whose payload is the full WireGuard config text.
      - The raw config text itself.
  - Writes `/config/bootstrap_done` before rendering to enforce **one-time bootstrap** semantics.

## Security notes

- The **bootstrap page only** (`/bootstrap`) is served over HTTPS at `https://<appname>.fly.dev` and terminated by Fly.
- The **VPN tunnel** itself is standard WireGuard over UDP port `51820`:
  - The tunnel is end-to-end encrypted by WireGuard, but it does *not* use TLS.
  - From the outside, this looks like normal WireGuard UDP traffic, not HTTPS.
- If you set a `BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` secret:
  - `/bootstrap` requires a matching `?token=...` query parameter.
  - The token is never stored in the repo; it lives only in Fly secrets.
- WireGuard private keys and peer configs live only on the Fly volume at `/config`.
- Once bootstrapped:
  - `/bootstrap` is effectively disabled (returns HTTP 410).
  - You interact only through your WireGuard clients; there is no ongoing web UI.

This setup is intended as a **personal convenience VPN**, not an anonymity network. Fly’s egress IPs and geo-location behaviour may not always match your selected region exactly, and outbound traffic does not necessarily originate from the app’s public IP.

---

## Known issues

- Currently outbound traffic from Fly.io does not always go via the public IP of the instance.
- Fly.io IP addresses may not reliably geo-locate to the region where you run the app, which can matter if you want to use the VPN for geo-fenced content.
